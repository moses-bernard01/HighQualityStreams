# Identifying High Quality Rivers and Streams in Connecticut

## Abstract
---

The objective  of the clean water act is to 'restore and maintain the chemical, physical and biological integrity of the Nation's waters.'  However, much of the work conducted to date both around the country and in Connecticut has focused on restoring impaired waters. More recent work under EPA's [healthy watersheds program](https://www.epa.gov/hwp) and [in Connecticut](https://portal.ct.gov/-/media/DEEP/water/water_quality_management/monitoringpubs/Bellucci-et-al-2011-Northeastern-Naturalist.pdf) has begun to bring more emphasis on identifying and protecting high quality waters.  These efforts are needed as [preliminary work in Connecticut](https://marybecker.github.io/Biointegrity/) noted the possible reduction of taxa highly sensitive to pollution (BCG 2 - Figure 1) at long-term sentinel stream monitoring stations over the past ~ 30 years.  

This project seeks to explore how drainage basin characteristics differ in least disturbed high quality Connecticut streams that support highly sensitive taxa compared to streams with more human alteration and .  This information will be used to identify and map the high quality streams across the State of Connecticut.  This type of information could be used to target and support protective management efforts for these streams.
